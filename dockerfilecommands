ADD:- copies file from host to container.

# Usage: ADD [source directory or URL] [destination directory]
ADD /my_app_folder /my_app_folder



CMD:- The command CMD, similarly to RUN, can be used for executing a specific command. However, unlike RUN it is not executed during build, but when a container is instantiated using the image being built.
      An example for CMD would be running an application upon creation of a container which is already installed using RUN (e.g. RUN apt-get install …) inside the image. This default application execution command that is set with CMD becomes the default and replaces any command which is passed during the creation.

# Usage 1: CMD application "argument", "argument", ..
CMD "echo" "Hello docker!"					# shell form
CMD ["/bin/echo", "Hello world"]				# exec form.



ENTRYPOINT: ENTRYPOINT argument sets the concrete default application that is used every time a container is created using the image. 
            For example, if you have installed a specific application inside an image and you will use this image to only run that application, 
            you can state it with ENTRYPOINT and whenever a container is created from that image, your application will be the target.

ENV name John Dow
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo", "Hello, $name"]			# Output: Hello $name

ENV name John Dow
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo Hello, $name"] 		# Output: Hello, John Dow



RUN: The RUN command is the central executing directive for Dockerfiles. It takes a command as its argument and runs it to form the image. Unlike CMD, it actually is used to build the image (forming another layer on top of the previous one which is committed).
# Usage: RUN [command]
RUN aptitude install -y riak




ENV: The ENV command is used to set the environment variables (one or more). These variables consist of “key value” pairs which can be accessed within the container by scripts and applications alike. 
# Usage: ENV key value
ENV SERVER_WORKS 4



EXPOSE: The EXPOSE command is used to associate a specified port to enable networking between the running process inside the container and the outside world (i.e. the host).
# Usage: EXPOSE [port]
EXPOSE 8080


MAINTAINER: One of the commands that can be set anywhere in the file - although it would be better if it was declared on top - is MAINTAINER. 
# Usage: MAINTAINER [name]
MAINTAINER authors_name


VOLUME: The VOLUME command is used to enable access from your container to a directory on the host machine (i.e. mounting it).
# Usage: VOLUME ["/dir_1", "/dir_2" ..]
VOLUME ["/my_files"]
